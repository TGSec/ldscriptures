Installing
==========

Beginning from the begin, we need to first install the library before we start using it.
The recommended installation method is the default Python module manager *pip*. You can also install it by downloading the project in Github and running the setup.py.
Both methods will be explained in this article.

Installation via pip
--------------------

The most basic way of installing LDSCriptures is using pip:

.. code-block:: bash
   
   pip install ldscriptures
 
Of, if you want to update it:

.. code-block:: bash
   
   pip install -U ldscriptures

Installing via setup.py
-----------------------

Ok, ok, you want the hard way. First, you need to download the `zip file`__ containing the module, from Github.

Next, you need to extract the files. After extracting, you just need to run the following command in the directory that you extracted (where "xx" is your Python version):

.. code-block:: bash
   
   pythonxx setup.py install

Or, if you just want to build it:

.. code-block:: bash
   
   pythonxx setup.py build
